A data structure to cache strings efficiently, with minimal memory footprint and the ability to assicate
the interned strings with unique symbols.
These symbols allow for constant time comparisons and look-ups to the underlying interned string contents.
Also, iterating through the interned strings is cache efficient.

## Contributing

### Testing

Test the project using
```
cargo test
```

### Memory Allocation Tests

To further test memory consumption and allocatios performed by the
different string interner backends test the project as follows:
```
cargo test --features test-allocations -- --test-threads 1
```

- The `--features test-allocations` enables the memory allocations tests. 
- The `--test-thread 1` argument is required for the memory allocations tests
  since otherwise they interfere with each other causing them to randomly fail.
